Spotify Clone with AI Feature
This is a pixel-perfect clone of Spotify, built for the Pixel Perfect Hackathon 2025. The project replicates Spotify's user interface with an additional AI-powered feature to enhance the user experience.

Features
Pixel-perfect design: The design follows the exact layout of the original Spotify web application.

AI-powered music recommendations: Personalized music suggestions based on user listening history and preferences.

User-friendly interface: Easy navigation with intuitive controls and modern UI elements.

Search functionality: Users can search for songs, artists, albums, and playlists.

Responsive design: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

AI-Powered Feature
The AI tool integrated into the project offers personalized music recommendations. Based on the user’s listening history (mocked for the hackathon), the AI engine predicts songs that the user is likely to enjoy. The tool uses a basic collaborative filtering algorithm to suggest music from genres and artists similar to what the user has listened to previously.
